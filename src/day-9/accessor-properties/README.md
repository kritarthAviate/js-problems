## Instructions

Given an object, set a property `number` such that when the value is set to a decimal, it's binary is returned when accessed. See example for more info --

```js
const obj = accessorProperties();
obj.number = 36;
console.log(obj.number); // 100100
```

Write tests for it as well.

- Assert on the accessor property.
